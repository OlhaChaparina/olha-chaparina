        <h1> Ukrainian language</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Ukrainian (украї́нська мо́ва, ukrainska mova), is an <strong> East Slavic language </strong>of the
            Indo-European language
            family, spoken primarily in Ukraine. It is the native language of the Ukrainians.
            Written Ukrainian uses the Ukrainian alphabet, a variant of the Cyrillic script. The standard Ukrainian
            language is regulated by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NANU; particularly by its Institute
            for the Ukrainian Language), the Ukrainian language-information fund,[citation needed] and Potebnia
            Institute of Linguistics.

            Ukrainian is a descendent of Old East Slavic, a language spoken in the medieval state of <strong> Kievan
                Rus'</strong>. In the
            Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the language developed into Ruthenian, where it became an official language,
            before a
            process of Polonization began in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the 18th century, Ruthenian diverged
            into regional variants and the modern Ukrainian language developed in the territory of present-day Ukraine.
            <strong> In
                the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian language was later banned</strong> as a subject from schools and as a
            language of
            instruction as a result of Russification. However, through folk songs, itinerant musicians, and prominent
            authors, the language maintained a sufficient base in Western Ukraine.
